 <p class="govuk-body"> You will need your reference number again, so keep it safe. We will ask for your reference number when you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>enter the border control post</li>
  <li>contact us</li>
</ul>
 </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Add CHED numbers and Vehicle Registration Number (VRN)
      </h2>
<p>
    If you have not added these details yet, you must add them at least 24 hours before your arrival. We will email you 24 hours before your arrival to remind you.
 </p>

<p>We will use the CHED number to connect your inspection with the rest of your import documents. We will use the VRN to recognise your vehicle and allow it into the border control post.  </p>
